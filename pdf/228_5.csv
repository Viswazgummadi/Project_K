23. What is the purpose of dilute ammonium hydroxide in the procedure?,Neutralization and precipitation of nickel dimethylglyoximate
24. Why is dimethylglyoxime solution added cautiously?,To prevent excess reagent interfering with the precipitation process
25. What is the purpose of the acid mixture in the procedure?,Dissolution of the sample and fuming
26. Why is the precipitate washed with ammonium nitrate solution?,To remove impurities and improve purity of the precipitate
27. What is the function of tartaric acid solution in the procedure?,To maintain pH and aid in precipitation
28. What is the function of hydrofluoric acid in the procedure?,To dissolve silica present in the sample
29. How is the nickel dimethylglyoximate weighed?,After drying to constant weight
