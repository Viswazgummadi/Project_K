OUTLINE OF THE METHOD \n2.1 The sample is burnt in a stream of purified oxygen and the \ncarhnn dioxide formctl is al~wrlwtl, after purihation, in suitable \nahorhant and tlc~tcrminc~cl. \n3. REAGENTS \n3.1 Oxygen (On) - 90\u20195 percent minimum. \n3.2 Accarite or Soda Lime -- 0\u201980 to 2\u201900 mm. \n3.3 Magnesium Perchlorate - Mg (CIO( )2, 0.80 to 2\u201900 mm. \n3.4 Boat/Crucible - Boat/crucible of precise dimension for \naccommodating in the r&stance and induction furnace. \n3.4.1 Preignitc the boats/crucibles in air or oxygen in a furnace for \nan hour at 1 100\u00b0C and stnrc in a desiccator and check for consistancy \nof the blank values. \n3.5 Flux,\u2018Accelerator - Low carbon copper, red lead ( preignited \nat 550\u2019(Z), tin and iron of low carbon content. \n4. APPARATUS \n4.1 The apparatus recommended in IS : 6226 (Part l)-1971t may be \n11setl \n4.2 Instead 01\u2018 the resistance furnace, an induction furnace may also \nbe used. \n--- \n*Rules for rounding ofl\u2019 numerical valuer ( mid). \ntRecommcndation for apparatus for chemical analysis of metals: Put I \nDetermination of carbon by direct combustion. \n4 IS:228(Part4)-1987 \n5. SAMPLING \n5.1 The sample shall be drawn as prescribed in the relevant Indian \nStandards. \n5.2 The sample is to be cleaned with analar grade ether and acetone, \ndried in an air oven at 100 f 5\u00b0C. \n6. PROCEDURE \n6.1 Assemble the apparatus. Switch on the furnace, if it is a resistance \nfurnace, and allow it to attain a temperature of 1 05O\u2019C (see Note ), all \nthe while passing oxygen through the apparatus so that it bubbles \nfreely at the exit end of the train. Disconnect the absorption bulb, \nkeep in a desiccator till it attains room temperature and take the \ninitial weight. Repeat the operation till a constant weight is \nobtained. . \nNOTB - For high chromium and high nickel rteelr, the temperature of 1 250\u00b0C \nin recommended for complete comburtion. \n6.2 Weigh to the nearest 0\u2019001 g, 2\u20190 to 3\u20190 g of the test sample. \nTransfer to the preignited combustion boat covered at the bottom \nwith a thin layer of calcined alumina. Spread the sample evenly over \nthe top of the alumina and cover it with 2\u20190 to 3\u20190 g of the flux. \nIntroduce the boat slowly In the hot zone of the combustion tube. \n6.3 In the case of induction heating, weigh to the nearest 0\u2019001 g, 0\u20199 \nto 1\u20191 g of the sample and transfer to a preignited crucible. Add an \nequal quantity of the flux. Place the crucible in Position on the \npedestal post of the furnace, raise to the combustion position and \nlock the system. Pass oxygen through the system and ignite the sample. \n6.4 Maintain a rapid flow of oxygen ( 800 to 1 000 ml/min) throughout \nthe combustion, then reduce to 400 to 500 ml per min and maintain \nit for another 6 co 8 min in order to sweep out the carbon dioxide. \n6.5 Remove the absorption bulb and weigh it after keeping it in \ndesiccator till it attains room temperature. The increase in weight of \nthe bulb represents the carbon dioxide. \n6.6 Remove the boat or crucible and examine for any incomplete \ncombustion. If the sample is not thoroughly fused, repeat the \ndetermination with a fresh sample. \n6.7 Blank - Charge a prei nited boat or crucible, as the case may be, \nwith the same amount of B ux used in the determination and follow \nthe procedure as in 6.2 to 6.5. \n5 IS:228(Part4)-1981 \n7. CALCULATION \n7.1 Calculate the total carbon content of the sample as follows: \nCarbon, percent A-B = --x 27\u201929 c \nwhere \nA = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \ncarbon dioxide from the sample, \nB = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \ncarbon dioxide from the blank determination, and \nC= mass in g of the sample taken. \n8. ACCURACY \n8.1 The accuracy of the method is & 0\u201901 percent for carbon in the \nrange of 0\u20191 to 0\u201975 percent and f 0\u201902 percent for carbon \nabove 0\u201975 percent. \nAPPENDIX A \n( Clause 0.2 ) \nINDIAN STANDARDS ON METHODS FOR CHEMICAL \nANALYSIS OF STEELS \nIS : 228 Methods for chemical analysis of steels: \n( Part 1 )-I972 Determination of carbon by volumetric method \n( for carbon > 0\u20191 percent ) ( second revision ) \n( Part 2)-1972 Determination of manganese in plain carbon and \nlow alloy steels by arsenite method ( second revision ) \n( Part 3 )-1972 Determination of phosphorus by alkalimetric method \n( second rcvisiorr ) \n( Part 4 )-1987 Determination of total carbon by gravimetric method \n( for carbon ) 0\u20191 percent ) ( third revision ) \n( Part 5 )-I974 Determination of nickel by dimethyl lyoxime \nravimetric ) method ( for nickel > 0\u20195 percent \n?!Xon ) s ( second \nG IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \n(Part S)-1974 Determination of chromium hy persi!ipha?e \noxidation method ( for chromium > 0\u20185 percent : I serond \nrcuision ) \n( Part 7 )-1974 Determination of molybdenum by a-bcnzoinoxirne \nmethod ( for molybdenum > 1 pwccnt ) ( ~vtond rFi/iJiott ) \n( Part 8)-1975 Determination of silicon by the_ ~ravimetric method \n( for silicon > 0\u2019 1 percent ) ( second reutszon ) \n(Part 9)-1975 Determination of sulphur in plain CW~J(JII steels by \nevolution met hod (second revirion ) \n( Parr 10 )-1976 Determination of molybdenum by thiocyannte \n(photometric) method ( for molybdenum up to 1 perwnt ) \nin low and high alloy steels ( second reviJir,tl ) \n( Part 11 )-1976 Determination of silicon by photometric method in \ncarbon steels and low alloy steels ( for silicon 0\u201901 to 0\u201905 \npercent ) ( second relision ) \n( Part 12 )-I976 Determination Of manganese hy periodate \n(photometric) method in low and high i\\lloy steels ( for \nmanganese up to 2 percent ) ( second revision ) \n( Part 13 )-1982 Determination of arsenic \n7 IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \nRaprcsraIing \nSteel Authority of India Ltd (Durgapur Steel \nPlant ), Durgapur \nSJIRI P.

SAMPLING \n5.1 The sample shall be drawn as prescribed in the relevant Indian \nStandards. \n5.2 The sample is to be cleaned with analar grade ether and acetone, \ndried in an air oven at 100 f 5\u00b0C. \n6. PROCEDURE \n6.1 Assemble the apparatus. Switch on the furnace, if it is a resistance \nfurnace, and allow it to attain a temperature of 1 05O\u2019C (see Note ), all \nthe while passing oxygen through the apparatus so that it bubbles \nfreely at the exit end of the train. Disconnect the absorption bulb, \nkeep in a desiccator till it attains room temperature and take the \ninitial weight. Repeat the operation till a constant weight is \nobtained. . \nNOTB - For high chromium and high nickel rteelr, the temperature of 1 250\u00b0C \nin recommended for complete comburtion. \n6.2 Weigh to the nearest 0\u2019001 g, 2\u20190 to 3\u20190 g of the test sample. \nTransfer to the preignited combustion boat covered at the bottom \nwith a thin layer of calcined alumina. Spread the sample evenly over \nthe top of the alumina and cover it with 2\u20190 to 3\u20190 g of the flux. \nIntroduce the boat slowly In the hot zone of the combustion tube. \n6.3 In the case of induction heating, weigh to the nearest 0\u2019001 g, 0\u20199 \nto 1\u20191 g of the sample and transfer to a preignited crucible. Add an \nequal quantity of the flux. Place the crucible in Position on the \npedestal post of the furnace, raise to the combustion position and \nlock the system. Pass oxygen through the system and ignite the sample. \n6.4 Maintain a rapid flow of oxygen ( 800 to 1 000 ml/min) throughout \nthe combustion, then reduce to 400 to 500 ml per min and maintain \nit for another 6 co 8 min in order to sweep out the carbon dioxide. \n6.5 Remove the absorption bulb and weigh it after keeping it in \ndesiccator till it attains room temperature. The increase in weight of \nthe bulb represents the carbon dioxide. \n6.6 Remove the boat or crucible and examine for any incomplete \ncombustion. If the sample is not thoroughly fused, repeat the \ndetermination with a fresh sample. \n6.7 Blank - Charge a prei nited boat or crucible, as the case may be, \nwith the same amount of B ux used in the determination and follow \nthe procedure as in 6.2 to 6.5. \n5 IS:228(Part4)-1981 \n7. CALCULATION \n7.1 Calculate the total carbon content of the sample as follows: \nCarbon, percent A-B = --x 27\u201929 c \nwhere \nA = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \ncarbon dioxide from the sample, \nB = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \ncarbon dioxide from the blank determination, and \nC= mass in g of the sample taken. \n8.

FOREWORD \n0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 4 ) (Third R cvision ) was adopted I)y \nthe Indian Standards Institution on 16 January 1987, afirr the draft \nfinalized by the Methods of Chemical Analysis of Pcrrous Metals \nSectional Committre had been approved by the Structural and Mct;~ls \nDivision Council. \n0.2 IS : 228, which was issued as a tentative standard in 1952 and \nrevised in 1959, covered the chemical analysis of pig iron, cast iron and \nplain carbon and low alloy steels. For the convenience it was decidctl \nto publish a comprehensive series on chemical analysis of steels \nincluding high alloy steels. Accordingly, revision of IS : 228 was \ntaken-up again and new series on method of chemical analysis of \nsteels including high alloy steels was published in various parts as \nIS : 228 ( Parts 1 to 13 ) ( see Appendix A ) covering separate method \nof analysis for each constituent in steels. However, IS : 228-195!)* \nversion has been rctainc tl for the analysis of pig iron and cast iron till \na separate standard for analysis of pig iron and cast iron is phlishctl. \n0.2.1 This revision of IS : 228 (Part 4)-19747 has been undcrtnkcn \non the basis of experience gained during the implementation of \\he \nstandard by the manufacturers and testing laboratories. \n0.3 In this revision, method has been updated. \n*Methods of chemical analysis of pig iron, cast won and plain carb\u2019on and low \nalloy 1teela [ rruiud )* \ntMethod1 for chemical analysis of steels: Part 4 Determination of carbon by \ngravimetric method ( for carbon > 0.1 percent ) (rend rmi~ion ). \n3 IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \n8.4 In rr,porting 111~ reslllt of a test or analysis made in accordance \nr\\.itIl tItis 51 ;~ntlartl, if the final value, ohservcd or calculated, is to be \nI r)~~trcIt~tI 011; it >11;111 Iw clone in accordance with IS : 2-1960*. \n1. SCOPE \n1.1 This standard (Part 4) covers the method for determination of \ntotal carljon content of plain carbon, low alloy and high alloy steels \nnfO.1 pcrccnt and above by the grnvimctric method. \n2. OUTLINE OF THE METHOD \n2.1 The sample is burnt in a stream of purified oxygen and the \ncarhnn dioxide formctl is al~wrlwtl, after purihation, in suitable \nahorhant and tlc~tcrminc~cl. \n3. REAGENTS \n3.1 Oxygen (On) - 90\u20195 percent minimum. \n3.2 Accarite or Soda Lime -- 0\u201980 to 2\u201900 mm. \n3.3 Magnesium Perchlorate - Mg (CIO( )2, 0.80 to 2\u201900 mm. \n3.4 Boat/Crucible - Boat/crucible of precise dimension for \naccommodating in the r&stance and induction furnace. \n3.4.1 Preignitc the boats/crucibles in air or oxygen in a furnace for \nan hour at 1 100\u00b0C and stnrc in a desiccator and check for consistancy \nof the blank values. \n3.5 Flux,\u2018Accelerator - Low carbon copper, red lead ( preignited \nat 550\u2019(Z), tin and iron of low carbon content. \n4. APPARATUS \n4.1 The apparatus recommended in IS : 6226 (Part l)-1971t may be \n11setl \n4.2 Instead 01\u2018 the resistance furnace, an induction furnace may also \nbe used. \n--- \n*Rules for rounding ofl\u2019 numerical valuer ( mid). \ntRecommcndation for apparatus for chemical analysis of metals: Put I \nDetermination of carbon by direct combustion. \n4 IS:228(Part4)-1987 \n5. SAMPLING \n5.1 The sample shall be drawn as prescribed in the relevant Indian \nStandards. \n5.2 The sample is to be cleaned with analar grade ether and acetone, \ndried in an air oven at 100 f 5\u00b0C. \n6. PROCEDURE \n6.1 Assemble the apparatus. Switch on the furnace, if it is a resistance \nfurnace, and allow it to attain a temperature of 1 05O\u2019C (see Note ), all \nthe while passing oxygen through the apparatus so that it bubbles \nfreely at the exit end of the train. Disconnect the absorption bulb, \nkeep in a desiccator till it attains room temperature and take the \ninitial weight. Repeat the operation till a constant weight is \nobtained. . \nNOTB - For high chromium and high nickel rteelr, the temperature of 1 250\u00b0C \nin recommended for complete comburtion. \n6.2 Weigh to the nearest 0\u2019001 g, 2\u20190 to 3\u20190 g of the test sample. \nTransfer to the preignited combustion boat covered at the bottom \nwith a thin layer of calcined alumina. Spread the sample evenly over \nthe top of the alumina and cover it with 2\u20190 to 3\u20190 g of the flux. \nIntroduce the boat slowly In the hot zone of the combustion tube. \n6.3 In the case of induction heating, weigh to the nearest 0\u2019001 g, 0\u20199 \nto 1\u20191 g of the sample and transfer to a preignited crucible. Add an \nequal quantity of the flux. Place the crucible in Position on the \npedestal post of the furnace, raise to the combustion position and \nlock the system. Pass oxygen through the system and ignite the sample. \n6.4 Maintain a rapid flow of oxygen ( 800 to 1 000 ml/min) throughout \nthe combustion, then reduce to 400 to 500 ml per min and maintain \nit for another 6 co 8 min in order to sweep out the carbon dioxide. \n6.5 Remove the absorption bulb and weigh it after keeping it in \ndesiccator till it attains room temperature. The increase in weight of \nthe bulb represents the carbon dioxide. \n6.6 Remove the boat or crucible and examine for any incomplete \ncombustion. If the sample is not thoroughly fused, repeat the \ndetermination with a fresh sample. \n6.7 Blank - Charge a prei nited boat or crucible, as the case may be, \nwith the same amount of B ux used in the determination and follow \nthe procedure as in 6.2 to 6.5. \n5 IS:228(Part4)-1981 \n7. CALCULATION \n7.1 Calculate the total carbon content of the sample as follows: \nCarbon, percent A-B = --x 27\u201929 c \nwhere \nA = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \ncarbon dioxide from the sample, \nB = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \ncarbon dioxide from the blank determination, and \nC= mass in g of the sample taken. \n8. ACCURACY \n8.1 The accuracy of the method is & 0\u201901 percent for carbon in the \nrange of 0\u20191 to 0\u201975 percent and f 0\u201902 percent for carbon \nabove 0\u201975 percent. \nAPPENDIX A \n( Clause 0.2 ) \nINDIAN STANDARDS ON METHODS FOR CHEMICAL \nANALYSIS OF STEELS \nIS : 228 Methods for chemical analysis of steels: \n( Part 1 )-I972 Determination of carbon by volumetric method \n( for carbon > 0\u20191 percent ) ( second revision ) \n( Part 2)-1972 Determination of manganese in plain carbon and \nlow alloy steels by arsenite method ( second revision ) \n( Part 3 )-1972 Determination of phosphorus by alkalimetric method \n( second rcvisiorr ) \n( Part 4 )-1987 Determination of total carbon by gravimetric method \n( for carbon ) 0\u20191 percent ) ( third revision ) \n( Part 5 )-I974 Determination of nickel by dimethyl lyoxime \nravimetric ) method ( for nickel > 0\u20195 percent \n?!Xon ) s ( second \nG IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \n(Part S)-1974 Determination of chromium hy persi!ipha?e \noxidation method ( for chromium > 0\u20185 percent : I serond \nrcuision ) \n( Part 7 )-1974 Determination of molybdenum by a-bcnzoinoxirne \nmethod ( for molybdenum > 1 pwccnt ) ( ~vtond rFi/iJiott ) \n( Part 8)-1975 Determination of silicon by the_ ~ravimetric method \n( for silicon > 0\u2019 1 percent ) ( second reutszon ) \n(Part 9)-1975 Determination of sulphur in plain CW~J(JII steels by \nevolution met hod (second revirion ) \n( Parr 10 )-1976 Determination of molybdenum by thiocyannte \n(photometric) method ( for molybdenum up to 1 perwnt ) \nin low and high alloy steels ( second reviJir,tl ) \n( Part 11 )-1976 Determination of silicon by photometric method in \ncarbon steels and low alloy steels ( for silicon 0\u201901 to 0\u201905 \npercent ) ( second relision ) \n( Part 12 )-I976 Determination Of manganese hy periodate \n(photometric) method in low and high i\\lloy steels ( for \nmanganese up to 2 percent ) ( second revision ) \n( Part 13 )-1982 Determination of arsenic \n7 IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \nRaprcsraIing \nSteel Authority of India Ltd (Durgapur Steel \nPlant ), Durgapur \nSJIRI P.

OUTLINE OF THE METHOD \n2.1 The sample is burnt in a stream of purified oxygen and the \ncarhnn dioxide formctl is al~wrlwtl, after purihation, in suitable \nahorhant and tlc~tcrminc~cl. \n3. REAGENTS \n3.1 Oxygen (On) - 90\u20195 percent minimum. \n3.2 Accarite or Soda Lime -- 0\u201980 to 2\u201900 mm. \n3.3 Magnesium Perchlorate - Mg (CIO( )2, 0.80 to 2\u201900 mm. \n3.4 Boat/Crucible - Boat/crucible of precise dimension for \naccommodating in the r&stance and induction furnace. \n3.4.1 Preignitc the boats/crucibles in air or oxygen in a furnace for \nan hour at 1 100\u00b0C and stnrc in a desiccator and check for consistancy \nof the blank values. \n3.5 Flux,\u2018Accelerator - Low carbon copper, red lead ( preignited \nat 550\u2019(Z), tin and iron of low carbon content. \n4. APPARATUS \n4.1 The apparatus recommended in IS : 6226 (Part l)-1971t may be \n11setl \n4.2 Instead 01\u2018 the resistance furnace, an induction furnace may also \nbe used. \n--- \n*Rules for rounding ofl\u2019 numerical valuer ( mid). \ntRecommcndation for apparatus for chemical analysis of metals: Put I \nDetermination of carbon by direct combustion. \n4 IS:228(Part4)-1987 \n5. SAMPLING \n5.1 The sample shall be drawn as prescribed in the relevant Indian \nStandards. \n5.2 The sample is to be cleaned with analar grade ether and acetone, \ndried in an air oven at 100 f 5\u00b0C. \n6. PROCEDURE \n6.1 Assemble the apparatus. Switch on the furnace, if it is a resistance \nfurnace, and allow it to attain a temperature of 1 05O\u2019C (see Note ), all \nthe while passing oxygen through the apparatus so that it bubbles \nfreely at the exit end of the train. Disconnect the absorption bulb, \nkeep in a desiccator till it attains room temperature and take the \ninitial weight. Repeat the operation till a constant weight is \nobtained. . \nNOTB - For high chromium and high nickel rteelr, the temperature of 1 250\u00b0C \nin recommended for complete comburtion. \n6.2 Weigh to the nearest 0\u2019001 g, 2\u20190 to 3\u20190 g of the test sample. \nTransfer to the preignited combustion boat covered at the bottom \nwith a thin layer of calcined alumina. Spread the sample evenly over \nthe top of the alumina and cover it with 2\u20190 to 3\u20190 g of the flux. \nIntroduce the boat slowly In the hot zone of the combustion tube. \n6.3 In the case of induction heating, weigh to the nearest 0\u2019001 g, 0\u20199 \nto 1\u20191 g of the sample and transfer to a preignited crucible. Add an \nequal quantity of the flux. Place the crucible in Position on the \npedestal post of the furnace, raise to the combustion position and \nlock the system. Pass oxygen through the system and ignite the sample. \n6.4 Maintain a rapid flow of oxygen ( 800 to 1 000 ml/min) throughout \nthe combustion, then reduce to 400 to 500 ml per min and maintain \nit for another 6 co 8 min in order to sweep out the carbon dioxide. \n6.5 Remove the absorption bulb and weigh it after keeping it in \ndesiccator till it attains room temperature. The increase in weight of \nthe bulb represents the carbon dioxide. \n6.6 Remove the boat or crucible and examine for any incomplete \ncombustion. If the sample is not thoroughly fused, repeat the \ndetermination with a fresh sample. \n6.7 Blank - Charge a prei nited boat or crucible, as the case may be, \nwith the same amount of B ux used in the determination and follow \nthe procedure as in 6.2 to 6.5. \n5 IS:228(Part4)-1981 \n7. CALCULATION \n7.1 Calculate the total carbon content of the sample as follows: \nCarbon, percent A-B = --x 27\u201929 c \nwhere \nA = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \ncarbon dioxide from the sample, \nB = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \ncarbon dioxide from the blank determination, and \nC= mass in g of the sample taken. \n8. ACCURACY \n8.1 The accuracy of the method is & 0\u201901 percent for carbon in the \nrange of 0\u20191 to 0\u201975 percent and f 0\u201902 percent for carbon \nabove 0\u201975 percent. \nAPPENDIX A \n( Clause 0.2 ) \nINDIAN STANDARDS ON METHODS FOR CHEMICAL \nANALYSIS OF STEELS \nIS : 228 Methods for chemical analysis of steels: \n( Part 1 )-I972 Determination of carbon by volumetric method \n( for carbon > 0\u20191 percent ) ( second revision ) \n( Part 2)-1972 Determination of manganese in plain carbon and \nlow alloy steels by arsenite method ( second revision ) \n( Part 3 )-1972 Determination of phosphorus by alkalimetric method \n( second rcvisiorr ) \n( Part 4 )-1987 Determination of total carbon by gravimetric method \n( for carbon ) 0\u20191 percent ) ( third revision ) \n( Part 5 )-I974 Determination of nickel by dimethyl lyoxime \nravimetric ) method ( for nickel > 0\u20195 percent \n?!Xon ) s ( second \nG IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \n(Part S)-1974 Determination of chromium hy persi!ipha?e \noxidation method ( for chromium > 0\u20185 percent : I serond \nrcuision ) \n( Part 7 )-1974 Determination of molybdenum by a-bcnzoinoxirne \nmethod ( for molybdenum > 1 pwccnt ) ( ~vtond rFi/iJiott ) \n( Part 8)-1975 Determination of silicon by the_ ~ravimetric method \n( for silicon > 0\u2019 1 percent ) ( second reutszon ) \n(Part 9)-1975 Determination of sulphur in plain CW~J(JII steels by \nevolution met hod (second revirion ) \n( Parr 10 )-1976 Determination of molybdenum by thiocyannte \n(photometric) method ( for molybdenum up to 1 perwnt ) \nin low and high alloy steels ( second reviJir,tl ) \n( Part 11 )-1976 Determination of silicon by photometric method in \ncarbon steels and low alloy steels ( for silicon 0\u201901 to 0\u201905 \npercent ) ( second relision ) \n( Part 12 )-I976 Determination Of manganese hy periodate \n(photometric) method in low and high i\\lloy steels ( for \nmanganese up to 2 percent ) ( second revision ) \n( Part 13 )-1982 Determination of arsenic \n7 IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \nRaprcsraIing \nSteel Authority of India Ltd (Durgapur Steel \nPlant ), Durgapur \nSJIRI P.

FOREWORD \n0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 5 ) ( Third Revision ) was adopted by \nthe Indian Standards Institution on 16 January 1987, after the draft \nfinalized by the Methods of Chemical Analysis of Ferrous Metals \nSectional Committee had been approved by the Strtictural and Metals \nDivision Council. \n0.2 IS : 228, which was issued as a tentative standard in 1952 and \nrevised in 1959, covered the chemial analysis of pig iron, cast iron and \nplain carbon and low alloy steels. For the convenience it was decided \nto publish a comprehensive series on chemical analysis of steels includ- \ning high alloy steels. Accordingly, revision of IS : 228 was taken up \nand new series on methods of chemical analysis of steels \n&zsing high alloy steels was published in various parts as IS : 228 \n( Parts 1 to 13 ) ( see Appendix A ) covering separate method of \nanalysis for each constituent in steels. However, IS : 228-1959* version \nhas been retained for the analysis of pig iron and cast iron till a \nseparate standard for analysis of pig iron and cast iron is published. \n0.2.1 This revision of IS : 228 ( Part 5 )-1974t has been undertaken on \nthe basis of experience gained during the implementation of the \nstandard by the manufacturers and testing laboratories. \n0.3 In this revision major modifications are: \na) scope of the method has been modified by lowering the limit \nof nickel for determination from 0\u20195 to 0\u20191 percent, and \n--_ \n*Methods of chemical analyric of pig iron, cmt iron and plain carbon md low alloy \nIterlc (rcuircd). \ntMethod# of chemical analyG# of rtacla: Part 5 Determination of nickel by \niimetbylglyorime ( gravimetric ) method ( for nickel > 0\u20195 percent) ( wand rruision ). \n3 IS t 228 ( Part 5 ) - 1987 \n1)) inclusion of reproducibility of the method at the various levels \nof nickel content. \n0.4 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance \nwith this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be \nrounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS : 2-1960*. \n1. SCOPE \n1.1 This standard ( Part 5 ) covers method for determination of nickel \ncontent of low alloy and high alloy steels containing more than or equal \nto 0\u20191 percent nickel. \n2. SAMPLING \n2.1 The samples shall be drawn and prepared as prescribed in the \nrelevant Indian Standard. \n3. QUALITY OF REAGENTS \n3.1 Unless specified otherwise, analytical grade reagents and distil!ed \nwater ( see IS : 1070-1977t ) shall be employed in the test. \n4. OUTLINE OF THE METHOD \n4.1 After complexing interfering elements, nickel in the solution of the \nsample is precipitated as nickel dimethylglyoximate and weighed. \n5.

PROCEDURE \n6.1 For Low Alloy Steels - Weigh accurately about 2 to 3 g of the \nsample for nickel < 0\u20195 percent and 1 g for nickel up to 5 percent \nand transfer to a 400-ml beaker. Add 60 ml of dilute hydrochloric \nacid(1 :l). Cover the beaker and digest till the decomposition is \ncomplete. Add cautiously dropwise nitric acid. Boil until iron and \ncarbides are oxidized and brown fumes have been expelled. Add \n15 to 20 ml of perchloric acid and fume, evaporate to syrupy \nconsistency. \n6.1.1 Cool and add 100 ml of water. Heat to boiling, filter to remove \nsilica, if any, and wash with dilute hydrochloric acid ( 1 : 19 ). Cool \nand dilute to 250-ml in a volumetric flask. \n6.1.2 Take a suitable aliquot containing about 15 to 20 mg of nickel \nand dilute to 200 ml. Add 10 to 15 ml of tartaric acid solution, \nneutralize with dilute ammonium hydroxide and add 1 ml in excess. \nIf the solution is not clear, add more tartaric acid solutton and \nneutralize with dilute ammonium hydroxide. Add dilute hydrochloric \nacid (1 : 19) until slightly acidic and warm to 60 to 80\u00b0C. Add 25 \nto 30 ml of dimethylglyoxime solution ( too much reagent should not be \nused ). Add dilute ammonium hydroxide until slightly alkaline ( avoid \naddition of excess dilute ammonium hydroxide ).

FOREWORD \n0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 5 ) ( Third Revision ) was adopted by \nthe Indian Standards Institution on 16 January 1987, after the draft \nfinalized by the Methods of Chemical Analysis of Ferrous Metals \nSectional Committee had been approved by the Strtictural and Metals \nDivision Council. \n0.2 IS : 228, which was issued as a tentative standard in 1952 and \nrevised in 1959, covered the chemial analysis of pig iron, cast iron and \nplain carbon and low alloy steels. For the convenience it was decided \nto publish a comprehensive series on chemical analysis of steels includ- \ning high alloy steels. Accordingly, revision of IS : 228 was taken up \nand new series on methods of chemical analysis of steels \n&zsing high alloy steels was published in various parts as IS : 228 \n( Parts 1 to 13 ) ( see Appendix A ) covering separate method of \nanalysis for each constituent in steels. However, IS : 228-1959* version \nhas been retained for the analysis of pig iron and cast iron till a \nseparate standard for analysis of pig iron and cast iron is published. \n0.2.1 This revision of IS : 228 ( Part 5 )-1974t has been undertaken on \nthe basis of experience gained during the implementation of the \nstandard by the manufacturers and testing laboratories. \n0.3 In this revision major modifications are: \na) scope of the method has been modified by lowering the limit \nof nickel for determination from 0\u20195 to 0\u20191 percent, and \n--_ \n*Methods of chemical analyric of pig iron, cmt iron and plain carbon md low alloy \nIterlc (rcuircd). \ntMethod# of chemical analyG# of rtacla: Part 5 Determination of nickel by \niimetbylglyorime ( gravimetric ) method ( for nickel > 0\u20195 percent) ( wand rruision ). \n3 IS t 228 ( Part 5 ) - 1987 \n1)) inclusion of reproducibility of the method at the various levels \nof nickel content. \n0.4 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance \nwith this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be \nrounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS : 2-1960*. \n1. SCOPE \n1.1 This standard ( Part 5 ) covers method for determination of nickel \ncontent of low alloy and high alloy steels containing more than or equal \nto 0\u20191 percent nickel. \n2. SAMPLING \n2.1 The samples shall be drawn and prepared as prescribed in the \nrelevant Indian Standard. \n3. QUALITY OF REAGENTS \n3.1 Unless specified otherwise, analytical grade reagents and distil!ed \nwater ( see IS : 1070-1977t ) shall be employed in the test. \n4. OUTLINE OF THE METHOD \n4.1 After complexing interfering elements, nickel in the solution of the \nsample is precipitated as nickel dimethylglyoximate and weighed. \n5. REAGENTS \n5.1 \n5.2 \n5.3 \n5.4 \n5.5 \n5.6 Dilate Hydrochloric Acid - 1 : 1 and 1 : 19 ( v/v ). \nDilute Nitric Acid- 1 : 1 (v/v). \nPerchloric Acid - 70 percent. \nTartaric Acid Solution - 50 percent ( m/v ). \nDilute Ainmonium Hydroxide - 1 : 1 (v/v). \nDimethylglyoxime Solution - 1 percent ( m, u ). \nthe solid reagent in 100 ml of rectified spirit. Dissolve 1 g of \n-;Ruler for rounding off numerical valuer ( revised ). \ntSprcification for water for general laboratory use ( second rmirim ). \n4 IS:228(Part5)-1987 \n5.7 Ammoniacal Ammonium Nitrate Solution - Dissolve 1 g of \nammonium nitrate in 100 ml of water and make it slightly alkaline to \nmethyl red with dilute ammonium hydroxide. \n5.8 Acid Mixture - Make up as follows: \nConcentrated hydrochloric acid ( rd = 1\u201916 \nconforming to IS : 265-1976\u2019 ) 400 ml \nConcentrated nitric acid ( rd == 1\u201942 \nconforming to IS : 264-1976t ) \nPerchloris acid (rd = 1\u201956 ) \nWater 180 ml \n600 ml \n680 ml \n5.9 Hydrofiuoric Acid - 40 percent. \n5.10 Concentrated Hydrochloric Acid - Relative density 1\u201916 \n( conforming to IS : 265-1976* ). \n6. PROCEDURE \n6.1 For Low Alloy Steels - Weigh accurately about 2 to 3 g of the \nsample for nickel < 0\u20195 percent and 1 g for nickel up to 5 percent \nand transfer to a 400-ml beaker. Add 60 ml of dilute hydrochloric \nacid(1 :l). Cover the beaker and digest till the decomposition is \ncomplete. Add cautiously dropwise nitric acid. Boil until iron and \ncarbides are oxidized and brown fumes have been expelled. Add \n15 to 20 ml of perchloric acid and fume, evaporate to syrupy \nconsistency. \n6.1.1 Cool and add 100 ml of water. Heat to boiling, filter to remove \nsilica, if any, and wash with dilute hydrochloric acid ( 1 : 19 ). Cool \nand dilute to 250-ml in a volumetric flask. \n6.1.2 Take a suitable aliquot containing about 15 to 20 mg of nickel \nand dilute to 200 ml. Add 10 to 15 ml of tartaric acid solution, \nneutralize with dilute ammonium hydroxide and add 1 ml in excess. \nIf the solution is not clear, add more tartaric acid solutton and \nneutralize with dilute ammonium hydroxide. Add dilute hydrochloric \nacid (1 : 19) until slightly acidic and warm to 60 to 80\u00b0C. Add 25 \nto 30 ml of dimethylglyoxime solution ( too much reagent should not be \nused ). Add dilute ammonium hydroxide until slightly alkaline ( avoid \naddition of excess dilute ammonium hydroxide ). Keep the beaker on \n*Specification for hydrochloric acid ( smnd rcvirion ). \ntsoecification for nitric acid ( semnd rctiim). IS:!228(Part5)-1987 \nhot-plate at 6O\u2019C with occasional stirring for 30 minutes. Cool to room \ntemperature. \n6.1.3 Filter through previously cleaned, dried and weighed sintered \nglass crucible No. 3, wash the precipitate with 10 ml cold ammoniacal \nammonium nitrate solution 6 to 8 times and then with the cold water. \n\u2018When the precipitate has been washed, discontinue the suction and dry \nthe precipitate at 15O\u2019C to constant weight. Cool in a desiccator and \nweigh as nickel dimethylglyoximate. \n6.2 For High Nickel and High Chromium Steels -Take 0\u20195 to \n1 g of sample in a 400-ml be.lker, add 40 ml of the acid mixture and \nheat gently first and when the sample has dissolved, allcw it to fume \nand continue fuming for 7 to 10 minutes. In case the sample does not \ndissolve, add few drops of hydrofluoric acid and fume, and cool, \u2019 \ndilute with 75 ml of water and filter. Wash the residue with dilute \nhydrochloric acid (1 : 19). Collect the filtrate and washiugs in a \nbeaker, transfer to 250-ml volumetric flask and make up the volume of \nthe filtrate to 250 ml. Complete the determination as in 6.1.2 and 6.1.3. \n6.3 For Tungsten Steels - If the steel contains tungsten, add 10 ml \nconcentrated hydrochloric acid to solution obtained under 6.1 and \ndilute to 150 ml; add some ashless paper pulp, digest at 60\u00b0C and allow \nthe precipitate to settle and filter through \nwith hot dilute hydrochloric acid (1 : 19). 6 aper pulp pad and wash \niscard the residue. Cool \nthe filtrate and dilute to a known volume with water. Follow further \nthe procedure given under 6.1.1 to 6.1.3. \nNOTE -If appreciable cobalt ( over 1 percent ) or copper ( over 1 percent ) is \nprenent, dialolve the precipitate obtained under 6.13 into the original beaker with \namall quantitv of alternate w-her of hot dilute hydrochloric acid and warm water. \nRe-precipitate nickel aa under 6.1.2. \n7.

Cool to room \ntemperature. \n6.1.3 Filter through previously cleaned, dried and weighed sintered \nglass crucible No. 3, wash the precipitate with 10 ml cold ammoniacal \nammonium nitrate solution 6 to 8 times and then with the cold water. \n\u2018When the precipitate has been washed, discontinue the suction and dry \nthe precipitate at 15O\u2019C to constant weight. Cool in a desiccator and \nweigh as nickel dimethylglyoximate. \n6.2 For High Nickel and High Chromium Steels -Take 0\u20195 to \n1 g of sample in a 400-ml be.lker, add 40 ml of the acid mixture and \nheat gently first and when the sample has dissolved, allcw it to fume \nand continue fuming for 7 to 10 minutes. In case the sample does not \ndissolve, add few drops of hydrofluoric acid and fume, and cool, \u2019 \ndilute with 75 ml of water and filter. Wash the residue with dilute \nhydrochloric acid (1 : 19). Collect the filtrate and washiugs in a \nbeaker, transfer to 250-ml volumetric flask and make up the volume of \nthe filtrate to 250 ml. Complete the determination as in 6.1.2 and 6.1.3. \n6.3 For Tungsten Steels - If the steel contains tungsten, add 10 ml \nconcentrated hydrochloric acid to solution obtained under 6.1 and \ndilute to 150 ml; add some ashless paper pulp, digest at 60\u00b0C and allow \nthe precipitate to settle and filter through \nwith hot dilute hydrochloric acid (1 : 19). 6 aper pulp pad and wash \niscard the residue. Cool \nthe filtrate and dilute to a known volume with water. Follow further \nthe procedure given under 6.1.1 to 6.1.3. \nNOTE -If appreciable cobalt ( over 1 percent ) or copper ( over 1 percent ) is \nprenent, dialolve the precipitate obtained under 6.13 into the original beaker with \namall quantitv of alternate w-her of hot dilute hydrochloric acid and warm water. \nRe-precipitate nickel aa under 6.1.2. \n7.
