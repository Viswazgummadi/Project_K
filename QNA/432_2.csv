What are the cutting tolerances for wire specified in the standard?,"For wire, the cutting tolerances shall be as follows: Over 3 m and less than 3 m."
How often should tests be conducted according to the standard?,One tensile test and one bend test each shall be made for every 5 tonnes or less in any parcel of wire.
What tests are specified in the standard?,"The standard specifies tensile tests, proof stress tests, elongation tests, and reverse bend tests for wire."
How many re-tests are allowed if a test piece fails according to the standard?,"If a test piece fails, two further samples shall be selected for testing in respect of each failure."

What should be done if any of the test pieces fail to pass the specified tests according to the standard?,"Two further samples shall be selected for testing in respect of each failure. If these pass, the material is deemed to comply; if they fail, the material is considered not to have complied."
How are test pieces for tensile and bend tests selected according to the standard?,Test pieces shall be selected either from the cuttings of lengths of wires or ends of coils of wires or from the coil or length of wire after it has been cut to the required or specified length.
