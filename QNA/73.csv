Question,Answer
" IS Code 5 covers the physical and chemical requirements of paving bitumens for use in roadways, runways, and allied constructions.",
"The standard mentions two types of paving bitumen: Type 1, derived from non-waxy crude, and Type 2, derived from waxy crude.",
Type 1 paving bitumen has six grades designated with a letter 'S' followed by a numeral representing the mean of the penetration limits specified for the grade. Type 2 paving bitumen has four grades designated with a letter 'A' followed by a numeral representing the mean of the penetration limits specified for the grade.,
Paving bitumen is primarily prepared by the distillation of suitable crude petroleum oil with or without subsequent blending with other grades and/or air blowing.,
"Paving bitumen Type 1 and Type 2 must satisfy specific requirements listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, including characteristics such as specific gravity, water content, flash point, softening point, penetration, ductility, wax content, and more.",
"Tests for paving bitumen Type 1 and Type 2 are described in methods referred to in columns 9 and 7 of Tables 1 and 2, respectively.",
Paving bitumen may be supplied in drums of Type A or Type B as per IS 3575:1989 or as agreed upon between the purchaser and the supplier.,
"Each container of paving bitumen should be legibly marked with the indication of the source of manufacture, month and year of manufacture, type and grade, and batch number.",
"Representative samples of the material should be drawn, and their conformity to the requirements of the standard should be judged as prescribed in Annex B.",
"The lot size for sampling is determined based on the number of containers, and the scale of sampling is detailed in Table 3, with the number of containers to be selected based on the size of the lot.",
Annex A provides a list of Indian Standards that are necessary adjuncts to the main standard.,
"able 1 lists thirteen characteristics for Paving Bitumen Type 1, including specific gravity, water content, flash point, softening point, penetration, ductility, paraffin wax content, loss on heating, retained penetration after thin film oven test, and more.",
"The testing methods referred to for Paving Bitumen Type 1 are described in columns 9 of Table 1, and they include IS codes such as IS1202:1978, IS1211:1978, IS1448(P:69):1969, IS1205:1978, IS1203:1978, IS1208:1978, IS10512:1983, IS9381:1979, IS1212:1978, IS9382:1979, IS1216:1978, and IS1206(Part 2):1978.",
"The specific gravity requirement for Paving Bitumen Type 2 at 27°C is a minimum of 0.99, as specified in Table 2.",
"The maximum water content allowed in Paving Bitumen Type 2 is 0.2 percent by mass, as specified in Table 2.",
The method for determining the flash point of Paving Bitumen Type 2 is described in IS1448(P:69):1969.,The method for determining the retained penetration after thin film oven test for Paving Bitumen Type 2 is described in IS9382:1979.
"The softening point range for Grade A 90 of Paving Bitumen Type 2 is 35 to 50°C, as specified in Table 2.",
"The penetration range for Grade A 65 of Paving Bitumen Type 2 is 60 to 70 1/10 mm, as specified in Table 2.",
"The maximum paraffin wax content allowed in Grade A 35 of Paving Bitumen Type 2 is 10 percent by mass, as specified in Table 2.",
The method for determining the retained penetration after thin film oven test for Paving Bitumen Type 2 is described in IS9382:1979.,
"Annex B provides sampling and criteria for conformity, outlining the procedures for drawing representative samples and judging conformity to the standard.",
" In the context of sampling, a lot consists of all the containers of the same type, same grade, and belonging to the same batch of manufacture.",
"For a lot containing 151 to 500 containers, 7 containers should be selected for sampling, as specified in Table 3.",
"To ensure the randomness of container selection for sampling, the procedure given in IS 4905:1968 may be followed.",
"All individual samples should be tested for softening point, penetration, and ductility.",
 The mean ( ) is calculated by dividing the sum of the test results by the number of test results.,
The range (R) is calculated by finding the difference between the largest and smallest test results.,
A lot shall be considered conforming to the standard if both the mean ( ) and range (R) of test results meet the specified requirements for each characteristic.,
Amendments are issued to standards as needed based on comments and periodic reviews. They may involve changes or reaffirmation of existing standards.,
Users of Indian Standards are advised to refer to the latest issue of the 'BIS Catalogue' and 'Standards: Monthly Additions' to ensure they have the latest amendments or edition of a standard.,
