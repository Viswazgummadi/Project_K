Question,Answer
What is the purpose of the Indian Standard IS:228 (Part 6) - 1987?,The standard covers the persulphate oxidation method for determining the chromium content of low alloy and high alloy steels containing 0.1 percent chromium or more.
When was the Indian Standard IS:228 (Part 6) - 1987 adopted?,"The standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution on January 16, 1987."
What does IS:228 (Part 6) - 1987 revise?,"It revises the methods of chemical analysis of pig iron, cast iron, plain carbon, and low alloy steels."
What modification was made to the scope of the method in the revision?,The limit for determination of chromium was lowered from 0.5 to 0.1 percent.
What is the purpose of the phosphoric acid-sulphuric acid mixture in the method?,The mixture is used for the dissolution of the sample.
How is chromium oxidized in the method?,Chromium is oxidized by persulphate in the presence of silver nitrate as a catalyst.
What is the purpose of dilute hydrochloric acid in the procedure?,Dilute hydrochloric acid is used to destroy permanganic acid coloration.
How is the titration back-titrated in the method?,The titration is back-titrated with standard potassium permanganate solution to a permanent pink end point.
What is the method used to correct for dilution effect and color interference?,The correction is made by adding the same amount of ferrous ammonium sulphate as used for the sample and titrating with standard potassium permanganate to a pink end point.
What is the calculation formula for determining chromium content?,"Chromium percent = (AB - C) x D x 0.01733 x 100, where A = volume of standard ferrous ammonium sulphate solution added, B = volume of standard potassium permanganate solution equivalent to 1 ml of ferrous ammonium sulphate solution, C = volume of standard potassium permanganate solution required for titration, corrected for the blank, D = normality of standard potassium permanganate solution, and E = mass of the sample."

What is the purpose of phosphoric acid in the procedure?,Phosphoric acid is used for dissolution of the sample.
How is the standard potassium permanganate solution prepared?,"It is prepared by dissolving potassium permanganate crystals in water, stirring, and allowing it to stand for 24 hours."
What is the purpose of adding glass beads during the procedure?,Glass beads are added to ensure even heating of the solution.
How is the permanganate color developed during the procedure?,The color is developed by adding silver nitrate and ammonium persulphate solutions and boiling the mixture.
What is the purpose of heating the solution during the procedure?,Heating is done to aid in the decomposition of the sample and to facilitate oxidation reactions.
What is the role of silver nitrate in the oxidation process?,Silver nitrate acts as a catalyst in the oxidation of chromium.
How is the sample prepared for the test?,"The sample is dissolved in a dilute sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid mixture, further treated with nitric acid, and then oxidized with silver nitrate and ammonium persulphate solutions."
