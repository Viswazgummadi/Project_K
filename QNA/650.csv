Question,Answer
1. What is the purpose of the standard laid down in this document?,To specify requirements for standard sand used in testing cement.
2. What are the particle size ranges specified for the standard sand?,"Below 500 microns but grater than 90 microns, smaller than 1 mm and greater than 500 microns; smaller than 2 mm and greater than 1 mm."
3. What is the reference standard for the sieves used in the testing of standard sand?,IS 460 (Part 1): 1985
4. How is the loss of mass due to organic impurities determined in the standard sand?,"By extraction with hot hydrochloric acid, followed by filtration, washing, drying, and ignition of the residue."
5. Where is the standard sand sourced from?,"Ennore, Tamil Nadu, with the possibility of sourcing particles greater than 1 mm from Mudaliarkuppam, Tamil Nadu."
6. What are the physical characteristics required for the standard sand?,"Quartz, light grey or whitish variety, angular grains, free from silt, with most grains being spherical, and only a negligible quantity of elongated and flatten grains."
7. What is the particle size distribution required for the standard sand?,"33.33% smaller than 2 mm and greater than 1 mm,33.3% smaller than 1mm and grater than 500 microns, 33.33% smaller than 500 microns and greater than 90 microns."
8. What is the permissible percentage of organic impurities in the standard sand?,Not more than 0.250 percent.
9. How is the sand tested for organic impurities?,"The sand shall be dried at 100°C for one hour. Two grams of the sand shall be trans- ferred to porcelain dish and 20 ml of hydro- chloric acid and 20 ml of distilled water added to it. This shall be heated on a water bath for one hour. It shall then be filtered, washed well with hot water, dried and ignited in a covered crucible. The mass of the residue shall be determined and the loss in mass calculated. "
10. How should each size fraction of the standard sand be packed?,"Separately in 50 kg or 25 kg jute canvas bags or metal containers, sealed properly, with particle size clearly marked on each bag/container."
11. What is the recommended material for the packaging of standard sand?,"Jute canvas conforming to IS 10036 (Part 2): 1982, or metal containers."
12. How should the particle size of the standard sand be indicated on the packaging?,Clearly and indelibly marked on each bag/container.
13. What must be included in the marking of standard sand?,"It may also bear the Standard Mark, or if not, it should be accompanied by a Certificate of Conformity from the Concrete and Soil Research Laboratory of Tamil Nadu, stating conformity to specifications."
14. What is the test method used to determine the loss of mass due to organic impurities?,"Treating with hydrochloric acid and distilled water, followed by filtration, washing, drying, and ignition of the residue."
15. What is the temperature and duration of drying required for testing organic impurities in the sand?,Dried at 100°C for one hour.
