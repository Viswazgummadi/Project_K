Question,Answer
What does the standard cover?,The standard covers the physical and chemical requirements of cutback bitumen from waxy crude of indigenous origin.
Which Indian Standard is referenced in this document?,"IS334:1982 Glossary of terms relating to bitumen and tar (second revision, re-affirmed 1991)."
What grades are specified for cutback bitumen from waxy crude?,"Light grade for use as primer, Medium grade for surface dressing and resurfacing operations, and Heavy grade for pre-mix type of construction."
How is the material manufactured?,The material is prepared by fluxing bitumen with distillates of petroleum or coal tar.
What information should be provided about the source and grade of the material?,The source and grade should be stated by the manufacturer.
Number of containers to be selected for sampling if lot size is up to 50?,2
How should the material be packed?,The material should be packed in mild steel drums of a size agreed upon between the purchaser and the supplier.
What information must be marked on each container of bitumen?,"Each container must be marked with the source of manufacture, source and grade of the material, month and year of manufacture, batch number, and tare and gross mass of the drum."
What is the significance of BIS Certification Marking?,"The containers may also be marked with the Standard Mark, governed by the provisions of Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1986."
How is sampling conducted?,"In any consignment, containers of the same grade and from the same batch constitute a lot. Samples are drawn from each container according to the size of the lot, and individual samples are stored separately."
What tests are conducted on individual samples?,Individual samples are tested for kinematic viscosity and ductility.
How are tests conducted on composite samples?,"For characteristics other than kinematic viscosity and ductility, a composite sample is prepared by mixing equal quantities from all individual samples, and tests are conducted on this composite sample."
What criteria determine conformity to the specification?,"Conformity is determined based on the mean and range calculated from test results for kinematic viscosity and ductility, as well as satisfaction of requirements for the composite sample."
How many containers are selected for sampling in a lot with up to 50 containers?,Two containers are selected for sampling.
How many containers are selected for sampling in a lot with 301 to 500 containers?,Seven containers are selected for sampling.
Which characteristics are tested individually on each sample?,Kinematic viscosity and ductility are tested individually on each sample.
How is the composite sample prepared for testing?,The composite sample is prepared by mixing equal quantities from all individual samples.
What conditions must be satisfied for conformity regarding kinematic viscosity and ductility?,The mean (X) and the range (R) calculated from test results must satisfy specific conditions relative to the minimum and maximum specified limits for the characteristic.
What determines whether the lot conforms to the specification?,"Conformity is determined by the satisfaction of conditions related to the mean and range of kinematic viscosity and ductility, as well as meeting the requirements for the composite sample test."
What are the characteristics tested for in the composite sample?,"The composite sample is tested for flash point, residue from distillation up to 360°C, water content, and tests on residue from distillation up to 360°C."
How are the number of containers selected for sampling determined?,"The number of containers selected depends on the size of the lot, as outlined in Table 2 of the document."
Which Indian Standards prescribe the methods for various tests?,"The methods for testing are prescribed in IS 1206 (Part III): 1978, IS 1209: 1978, IS 1213: 1978, IS 1206 (Part II): 1978, IS 1208: 1978, IS 1216: 1978, IS 1203: 1978, and IS 1211: 1978."
What is the permissible range for the residue from distillation up to 360°C for the medium grade?,The permissible range is 55% to 75% by volume.
What is the requirement for penetration for the heavy grade?,The requirement is a penetration of 25-50 for the heavy grade.
What is the requirement for the matter soluble in Trichloroethylene for the light grade?,The requirement is 99% for the matter soluble in Trichloroethylene for the light grade.
How is conformity determined for the composite sample?,Conformity for the composite sample is determined by whether it satisfies the corresponding requirements of the characteristics outlined in Table 1.
How is the batch of cutback bitumen classified as conforming to the specification?,"The batch is classified as conforming if specific conditions related to the mean and range of kinematic viscosity and ductility are met, and if the composite sample meets the outlined requirements."
What does the range (R) represent in the context of testing conformity?,The range (R) represents the difference between the highest and lowest values obtained from the tests conducted on individual samples.
"What is the purpose of the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1986 mentioned in the document?","The act governs the use of the Standard Mark, ensuring adherence to specified standards and regulations in the manufacturing and certification processes."
How can manufacturers obtain permission to use the Standard Mark?,Manufacturers can obtain permission from the Bureau of Indian Standards by meeting the specified conditions outlined in the Act and associated regulations.
Number of containers to be selected for sampling if lot size is up to 51-100?,3
Number of containers to be selected for sampling if lot size is up to 101-200?,4
Number of containers to be selected for sampling if lot size is up to 201-300?,2
Number of containers to be selected for sampling if lot size is up to 301-500?,7
Number of containers to be selected for sampling if lot size is up to 501?,10
