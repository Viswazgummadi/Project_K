Question,Answer
What is the scope of Indian Standard IS : 228 (Part 14) - 1988?,The standard covers a method for the determination of carbon in all types of steels and alloy steels in the range of 0.005 to 2.000 percent.
What is the principle of the thermal conductivity method for determining carbon content?,"The sample is burnt in a stream of oxygen in the presence of a metal catalyst, and the carbon dioxide formed is selectively adsorbed on a molecular sieve at a temperature of approximately 300°C, then released by heating."
How is carbon content determined using the thermal conductivity method?,"The difference in thermal conductivity between the carrier gas (usually helium) and the carrier gas containing carbon dioxide is measured, and it is proportional to the carbon content of the sample."
What reagents are required for the determination of carbon content by the thermal conductivity method?,"Reagents include oxygen, helium, Ascarite or Soda-Lime, magnesium perchlorate, concentrated sulphuric acid, sulphur trap containing manganese dioxide, carbon dioxide converter containing copper oxide, and accelerators such as copper, tin, or iron granules."
How is the instrument stability ensured before analysis?,The instrument stability is ensured by switching on the instrument and flowing purified oxygen through the thermal system at a rate of 1000 - 1500 ml/minute for 4 hours before analyzing the samples.
What is the procedure for standardization of the instrument?,"The pre-ignited crucible is filled with the standard sample having a known value of carbon and an accelerator. It is then inserted into the induction furnace, and after 30 seconds, the induction is started. The percentage of carbon is noted, and standardization is adjusted until the desired reproducibility is obtained."
How is the reproducibility of the analysis ensured?,"For each sample, 1 gram of accurately weighed sample, previously washed with organic solvent and dried, is transferred to the crucible along with 1 gram of accelerator. The crucible is then inserted into the induction furnace, and the percentage of carbon is determined."
What is the purpose of Ascarite or Soda-Lime in the method?,Ascarite or Soda-Lime is used to absorb carbon dioxide selectively during the determination process.
Why is magnesium perchlorate used in the procedure?,Magnesium perchlorate is used as a drying agent to remove moisture from the sample.
What is the function of the sulphur trap in the setup?,"The sulphur trap containing manganese dioxide removes sulfur compounds from the carrier gas, ensuring accurate analysis."
How is carbon dioxide converted in the carbon dioxide converter?,"Carbon dioxide is converted to oxygen in the carbon dioxide converter, containing copper oxide maintained at 300°C."
"Why are accelerators such as copper, tin, or iron granules used?",Accelerators are used to promote the combustion of the sample and ensure complete oxidation to carbon dioxide.
What precautions are taken during the sampling process?,Samples are drawn and prepared as prescribed in the relevant Indian Standard to ensure representative sampling.
How is the reproducibility of the analysis determined?,The reproducibility of the analysis is determined by repeating the process for each sample and comparing the results to ensure consistency.
What is the significance of pre-ignited crucibles in the method?,Pre-ignited crucibles of precise dimensions are used to ensure uniform and controlled combustion of the samples.
How does the thermal conductivity method differentiate between carbon dioxide and the carrier gas?,"The thermal conductivity method measures the difference in thermal conductivity between the carrier gas and the carrier gas containing carbon dioxide, which is proportional to the carbon content of the sample."
Why is the oxygen flow rate controlled during instrument stability?,The oxygen flow rate is controlled to ensure proper stabilization of the instrument and to remove any contaminants or impurities present in the system.
What is the role of the molecular sieve in the determination process?,"The molecular sieve selectively adsorbs carbon dioxide formed during the combustion of the sample, facilitating accurate measurement of carbon content."
How is the carbon content of the standard sample determined during standardization?,The carbon content of the standard sample is determined by noting the percentage of carbon obtained after combustion and adjusting the standardization until the desired reproducibility is achieved.
Why is helium used as the carrier gas in some cases?,"Helium is used as the carrier gas in some cases due to its low thermal conductivity, ensuring accurate measurement of the difference in thermal conductivity with carbon dioxide."
How is the accuracy of the analysis ensured during reproducibility testing?,The accuracy of the analysis is ensured by repeating the process multiple times and comparing the results to assess consistency and reproducibility.
What is the role of the detector in the thermal conductivity method?,"The detector, usually a thermistor cell, senses the difference in thermal conductivity between the carrier gas and the carrier gas containing carbon dioxide, providing a measure of the carbon content in the sample."
How is the percentage of carbon in the sample calculated?,The percentage of carbon in the sample is calculated based on the difference in thermal conductivity measured by the detector and the known parameters of the instrument setup.
What is the function of the accelerators in the determination process?,"Accelerators promote the combustion of the sample and facilitate complete oxidation to carbon dioxide, ensuring accurate measurement of carbon content."
Why is standardization necessary before analyzing the samples?,Standardization is necessary to calibrate the instrument and ensure accurate and reproducible results during sample analysis.
What precautions are taken during the preparation of the sample for analysis?,"The sample is washed with organic solvents such as acetone, benzene, or ether to remove any contaminants before analysis."
How is the stability of the instrument ensured during analysis?,The stability of the instrument is ensured by allowing the flow of purified oxygen through the thermal system for a specified duration before analyzing the samples.
What is the role of the induction furnace in the determination process?,"The induction furnace provides controlled heating conditions for the combustion of the sample, ensuring complete oxidation and accurate measurement of carbon content."
Why is the percentage of carbon adjusted during standardization?,The percentage of carbon is adjusted during standardization to ensure consistency and reproducibility of the results obtained from the standard sample.
What is the purpose of using pre-ignited crucibles of precise dimensions?,Pre-ignited crucibles of precise dimensions are used to ensure uniformity in sample combustion and accurate measurement of carbon content.
