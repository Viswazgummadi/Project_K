What is the requirement for the initial and final setting time of Portland slag cement?,"The initial setting time shall not be less than 30 minutes, and the final setting time shall not exceed 600 minutes when tested by the Vicat apparatus method described in IS 4031 (Part 5): 1988."
What is the purpose of the transverse strength test for plastic mortar in Portland slag cement?,"The transverse strength test assesses additional strength characteristics of Portland slag cement mortar, complementing the compressive strength test specified in the standard."
"What are the acceptable values for compressive strength of Portland slag cement at 3, 7, and 28 days?","The average compressive strength shall be not less than 16 MPa at 3 days, 22 MPa at 7 days, and 33 MPa at 28 days for Portland slag cement when tested as per IS 4031 (Part 6): 1988."
How should cement be stored to maintain its quality?,"Cement should be stored in a suitable weather-tight building to protect it from dampness and minimize warehouse deterioration, allowing easy access for inspection and identification."
What certifications should the manufacturer provide?,"The manufacturer should provide a certificate confirming that the cement conforms to the standard within ten days of dispatch, including information on chloride content if requested by the purchaser."
What are the acceptable packaging materials for Portland slag cement?,"Portland slag cement shall be packed in bags conforming to various Indian Standards, bearing the manufacturer's name or registered trademark, with appropriate markings indicating the cement type and net mass."
What is the permissible average net mass of cement per bag?,"The average net mass of cement per bag shall be 50 kg, as specified in the standard."
How is the cost of testing divided between the manufacturer and purchaser?,"The manufacturer bears the cost of testing if the cement does not comply with the standard, while the purchaser bears the cost if the cement complies."
Under what circumstances can cement be rejected?,Cement may be rejected if it fails to comply with any requirements specified in the standard or if it has been stored for an extended period without retesting.
What is the timeframe for taking samples and commencing tests?,"Samples shall be taken within three weeks of delivery, and all tests shall commence within one week of sampling, ensuring prompt assessment of cement quality."
How should samples be stored if testing cannot be conducted immediately?,"If testing cannot be conducted within one week, samples shall be packed and stored in airtight containers until testing, preventing contamination or alteration of cement properties."
What should be done if the initial soundness test fails to meet requirements?,"If the initial soundness test fails, further tests shall be conducted on another portion of the same sample after aeration, with expanded limits for acceptance to account for potential false set."
What is the temperature requirement for conducting physical tests on cement?,"Physical tests on cement should ideally be carried out at a temperature of 27 ± 2°C, with the actual temperature recorded during testing."
How is the water consistency of standard cement paste determined?,"The water consistency of standard cement paste is determined by a method described in IS 4031 (Part 4): 1988, which establishes the water content required to achieve standard consistency."
When can independent testing of cement be requested?,"Independent testing can be requested before or immediately after delivery at the option of the purchaser, ensuring unbiased assessment of cement quality."
What action can be taken if cement fails to comply with the standard after storage?,"Cement failing to conform to the standard after storage may be rejected and, if necessary, retested before use to ensure compliance with specified requirements, safeguarding against the use of substandard cement."
How is the number of bags in a sample taken for weighment determined?,The number of bags in a sample taken for weighment is determined by ensuring that the minus error in weight does not exceed 2% of the specified net mass and that the average net mass is at least 25 kg per bag.
What is the required minimum average net mass of cement packed in bags at the plant?,The required minimum average net mass of cement packed in bags at the plant is 50 kg.
"How many bags are required to be included in a sample for batch sizes ranging from 100 to 150, 151 to 280, and 281 to 500?","For batch sizes of 100 to 150, 151 to 280, and 281 to 500, the sample sizes should include 20, 32, and 50 bags, respectively."
What is the acceptable tolerance level for the minus error in bag weight within a sample?,"The acceptable tolerance level for the minus error in bag weight within a sample is not more than 5 percent of the bags in the sample. Additionally, the minus error in none of such bags in the sample shall exceed 4 percent of the specified net mass of cement in the bag."
